      <h2>ABOUT FELIX</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>
          Felix Morelo, a Colombian-American artist, has become a prominent
          figure in the New York City art scene with his distinctive and
          engaging street art. Known for his whimsical chalk drawings, Morelo
          has transformed the mundane sidewalks of NYC into interactive canvases
          that invite public participation and provoke thought. His work, which
          includes Good Luck and Bad Luck Spots, has been featured in multiple
          media outlets, including
          <strong>The New York Times</strong>, where Amelia Nierenberg writes:
        </p>

        <p>
          “Felix Morelo’s chalk circles give parks, paths, and pavements a burst
          of spiritual energy.”
        </p>

        <h3>Early Life and Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          Born in the United States, Morelo grew up with deep ties to his
          Colombian heritage. He moved to New York City at the age of eleven.
          His passion for art was evident from an early age, and he pursued
          formal education in the arts, studying painting at Parsons School of
          Design and drawing at The Art Students League of New York City.
          Initially, Morelo’s work consisted primarily of chalk-drawn faces
          scattered throughout the city. However, his artistic journey took a
          pivotal turn in 2010 when he began to create his now-famous “Good Luck
          Spots”.
        </p>

        <h3>Spots</h3>
        <p>
          Each spot, marked by a chalk circle, features messages such as “Good
          Luck Spot,” “Hugging Spot,” “Screaming Spot,” “Laughing Spot,” ”High
          Five Spot”, “Poetry Spot”, “Singing Spot”, “Kissing Spot”, “Jumping
          Spot”, “Crying Spot”, “Preaching Spot”, ”Farting Spot”, “Selfie Spot”
          ”Enlightenment Spot”, and many, many more. These installations are
          artistic expressions and social experiments aimed at challenging
          superstitions, taboos, and everyday routines. His controversial spots
          like “Racist,” “Suicide,” “Israel and Palestine”, “Genocide and
          Kidnapping”, “Cursing”, ”Fucking”, “Twerking”, “Pooping” and “Bad
          Luck” spots, have sparked street attacks, death threats, and intense
          debates among strangers, reflecting the power of his art to incite
          discussion and reflection. Morelo’s spots can be found in various
          parks and streets across Manhattan, including Union Square, Washington
          Square, Madison Square, and Tompkins Square Parks. The intention is to
          engage passersby, inviting them to interact with the artwork and, by
          extension, with each other. The interactive element is at the work’s
          core. The audience is given permission and invited to engage in
          spontaneous social interactions. The "Good Luck Spots" concept emerged
          as an evolution of Morelo's earlier work. Encouraged by a fellow
          artist to provide a conclusive element to his trails of chalk faces,
          Morelo introduced these spots as whimsical, interactive installations.
        </p>

        <h3>Two-way Commentary and CUBES SERIES</h3>
        <p>
          Deeply rooted in exploring human psychology and social behavior,
          Morelo’s chalk circles, often brightly colored and whimsically
          designed, serve as more than just art; they are tools for social
          interaction and community building. By drawing people into these
          spots, Morelo challenges the public to question their own beliefs and
          engage with their surroundings in new ways. This approach became
          particularly resonant in the post-pandemic world, where social
          distancing and isolation have become common themes. Morelo’s spots
          offer a playful yet poignant reminder of the importance of human
          connection. In addition to his “SPOTS”, Morelo's portfolio further
          explores humans’ multifaceted nature through his “CUBES SERIES”. This
          series, consisting of paintings, drawings, and sculptures, are surreal
          narratives presented as order, stability, and protection versus
          self-imposed limitations and restrictions. Within the “CUBE” shape and
          around it (which symbolizes NYC apartments for the artist), organic
          and chaotic experiences, feelings, desires, dreams, nightmares,
          wishes, and fantasies, and memories can be played out, explored, and
          analyzed. A contrast to his street art, which is public, and
          immediate, the “CUBE SERIES” is less well known, private and
          biographical, introspective, intricate and detailed, and full of
          symbols and characters in constant struggle and battles to overcome
          their limitations and reach enlightenment.
        </p>

        <h3>Exhibitions and Public Recognition</h3>
        <p>
          Morelo’s work has been featured at Newfields – Indianapolis Museum of
          Art, The Raynham Hall Museum of Oyster Bay, New Jersey City University
          Gallery, Westside Cultural Center in Atlanta, GA, Buck Town Center in

          Dianxi Science, Technology Normal University in Lingang, China, and
          Casa Juan Gallery in Cartagena, Colombia. His work has garnered both
          local and international attention, emphasizing his cultural and social
          impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New York City Artist Corps awarded him a grant in 2021, and five
          commissioned murals reach audiences daily in New York City, and he was
          the recipient of the Guaranteed Income for Artists Program in 2022.
